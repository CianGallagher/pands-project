Summary

The Iris data set is a classical data set used in machine learning, popularised by Ronald A. Fisher in 1936. It is sometimes referred to as the Anderson's dataset as it was botanist Edgar Anderson who originally collected the data. 
It includes 150 records of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The iris flowers are also classified by species into three types: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica.
