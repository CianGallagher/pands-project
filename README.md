Summary

The Iris data set is a classical data set used in machine learning, popularised by Ronald A. Fisher in 1936. It is sometimes referred to as the Anderson's dataset as it was botanist Edgar Anderson who originally collected the data on which the Fisher set is derived.
It includes 150 records of iris flowers, each having four features and a class (species). The features are as follows:

sepal length in centimetre.
sepal width in centimetre.
petal length in centimetre.
petal width in centimetre.

The iris flowers are also classified by species into three types each represented exactly 50 times. The species are as follows:

Iris Setosa.
Iris Versicolor.
Iris Virginica.

The primary objective of this dataset is to organise the species of Iris by petal and sepal dimensions.
